# fitness-data-Analysis

I successfully implemented a data analytics project focusing on analyzing activity levels from fitness tracker data. Using Python and pandas, I grouped data by user ID to calculate average daily steps and categorized users into sedentary, active, or very active groups based on their average steps per day. Visualizations included bar charts for average daily steps by day of the week and a correlation matrix to explore relationships between variables.

Further insights were derived by analyzing total activity minutes across different intensity levels (very active, fairly active, lightly active, sedentary) using pie charts. Techniques involved data cleaning, grouping, aggregation, and visualization using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. This project enhanced understanding of user behavior and provided actionable insights for health and fitness strategies.
